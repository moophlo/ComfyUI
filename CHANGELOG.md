## [Unreleased]

### Added
Added a loop to the run.sh script that uses the `find` command to recursively search for
`requirements.txt` files in all subdirectories of /dockerx/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/. Each file
found is then processed with pip to install any listed dependencies.

### Added
- Extracted the base image tag from the Dockerfileâ€™s FROM line and added it as an additional image tag during the push. This allows tracking of the underlying base image version used in the build.

### Added
- Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to derive the Docker image name dynamically from the GitHub repository name (using `${{ github.repository }}`), ensuring the image is tagged as `githubuser/repositoryname`.
- Modified the trigger so that the workflow runs only when the `Dockerfile` changes (using the `paths` filter) and on version tag pushes.
- Maintained existing tags for latest, commit SHA, semantic version (if applicable), and the base image tag from the Dockerfile.

### Added
- Modified the GitHub Actions workflow to convert the derived image name from `${{ github.repository }}` to all lowercase (using `tr`), ensuring that the Docker image name is always in lowercase.
